Before I moved into Austin, I used to participate very actively with the [Hacks/Hackers](http://hhba.info/) Community in Buenos Aires. I've participated in many hackathons and meetups with great people back in Argentina.

From the very begining we started building mapa76, an app to extract, analize, visualize unstructured data. I'll talk more about this wonderful tool pretty soon. **I promise**. For now I just want to share that Mapa76 (rebranded analice.me) has been on National TV in Argentina (sadly it's only in Spanish):

If you wanna find out more about the project you can visite the official [link](http://analice.me) or check the [Github page of the project](https://github.com/hhba/mapa76).
