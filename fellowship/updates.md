# Fellowship updates

### 09/03/2014
* MediaParty was Awesome! I talked about the data pipeline (with gaba), piratebox and a little bit about how we work at the News Apps team at the TT.
* There is a new explorer on the block! Local Debt Explorer. Now you can find how much tax-supported debt is held by any city in Texas. http://localdebt.texastribune.org/
* In the context of "Bypassed by the Miracle" (weeklong series on the people and communities that have missed out on Texas' economic success), we published No miracle here. http://apps.texastribune.org/no-miracle-here/
